SCU-First-Year-Course-Plan
==========================
This is a project designed for Santa Clara University's Software Engineering Class. It is intended to generate customized first year course plans for incoming Computer Engineering students based on their previous coursework (such as AP, IB, or other college level courses that may grant them credit). The front-end is mostly bootstrap.
